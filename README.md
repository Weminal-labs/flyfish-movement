🔥 Step into the future of **`market-driven AI decentralization`**!

## Overview Architecture

- **Frontend Cointainer** will constis of 2 components:
  - **Extension Components**: An extension that enables users to manually select and save website content they're interested in, storing their chosen data securely in decentralize storage. The extension allows users to:
    - Select specific content to save
    - Choose what data they want to collect
    - Store their selected content in decentralize storage
  You can find the extension components in this repository: [Extension Components](https://github.com/Weminal-labs/flyfish-extension)
  - **Web Client Components**: A chat interface that allows users to interact with **`FlyFish agent`** and get **`personalized collected data`** from decentralize storage from extension components above. You can find the web client components in this repository: [Web Client Components]()
- **Agent Container**: A container that contains the agent components.
This is the repository for Agent Container:
[Agent Container]()
This is the repository for building `movement plugin`: 
[Movement Plugin]()
We have publish our plugin in npmjs:
[Movement Plugin NPM]()

For a detailed breakdown of each component, please refer to the architecture documentation in their respective repositories.
